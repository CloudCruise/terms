# CloudCruise Terms of Service

**Effective date: June 29 2025**

Welcome to CloudCruise. These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) form a binding agreement between you and **CloudCruise, Inc.** (“CloudCruise,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and govern your use of all websites, APIs, dashboards, SDKs and related offerings we provide (collectively, the “**Services**”). By accessing or using any Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not accept every provision, do not use the Services.

## 1. Contact Information

* **Email:** [founders@cloudcruise.com](mailto:founders@cloudcruise.com)
* **Address:** CloudCruise, 1111B S Governors Ave, STE 7594, 19904 Dover, Delaware

---

## 2. Changes to These Terms

We continually improve the Services and may revise these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will post the new Terms on our website and, where feasible, notify registered account holders by email. Continued use after revisions become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 3. Privacy

Your use of the Services is also governed by our **Privacy Policy**. Please review it carefully, as it explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.

---

## 4. Eligibility & Account Registration

You must be at least 13 years old (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction) to create an account. When registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, keep your credentials secure, and notify us of any unauthorized use. If you create an account on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity.

---

## 5. Scope of the Services

CloudCruise offers a platform that **generates, executes, and maintains deterministic browser agents** capable of interacting with web or desktop interfaces, extracting and returning structured data, and self-repairing via third-party LLMs when workflows break. Agents may run in:

* **CloudCruise-hosted multi-tenant or single-tenant VPCs**, or
* **Customer-controlled environments** (on-premise or customer VPC).

You retain ownership of the input data, credentials, and extracted outputs you upload or instruct agents to handle. See Section 10 for additional obligations if your data contains **Protected Health Information (PHI)**.

---

## 6. Acceptable Use

When using the Services you will **not**:

1. Violate any law, regulation, or third-party terms of service (e.g., scrape sites in breach of their rules).
2. Upload or transmit malware, infringing content, or personal data without authority.
3. Attempt to probe, scan, or test system vulnerabilities, or bypass security.
4. Reverse-engineer or misuse the Services or any underlying software.
5. Use the Services for high-risk activities where errors could lead to death or personal injury (e.g., surgical control systems).

Violations may result in immediate suspension or termination.

---

## 7. Credentials, Automation Runs & Observability

* **Credentials.** You may supply portal log-ins, API keys, or other secrets so that agents can perform tasks. You authorize CloudCruise to store and encrypt such credentials, or (if self-hosted) to temporarily cache them in memory while a run executes.
* **Session Data.** CloudCruise records agent step logs, network traffic metadata, screenshots and session replays to help you audit, debug, and observe performance. By default, run artifacts are retained for account life time; configurable at the workspace level.
* **Consent.** You represent that you have provided all necessary notices and obtained all consents required for CloudCruise to process data on your behalf, including any end-user or patient consents for PHI.

---

## 8. Beta & Early-Access Features

We may label certain capabilities “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” or similar. Such features are **experimental and provided as-is without warranty**.

---

## 9. Fees & Billing

Some Services are free; others require payment (“**Paid Services**”). When you purchase Paid Services:

* You authorize us (via our payment processor – currently Stripe) to charge your chosen payment method.
* Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled before the current term ends.
* All fees are non-refundable except as required by law.

You are responsible for taxes, duties, and withholdings associated with your purchases.

---

## 10. PHI & HIPAA

CloudCruise can operate under a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** for covered entities or business associates subject to HIPAA. Unless you have an executed BAA with us, **do not upload PHI**. If you sign a BAA, that agreement supplements (and, in case of conflict, supersedes) these Terms for PHI-related processing.

---

## 11. Intellectual-Property Rights

Except for your data and browser agents you author, all software, documentation, and content provided by CloudCruise remain our exclusive property or that of our licensors. We grant you a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to access the Services solely for your internal business purposes. All trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed through the Services are owned by CloudCruise or third parties and may not be used without permission.

---

## 12. Third-Party Services

The Services integrate with third-party providers (e.g., LLM APIs, CAPTCHA solvers, proxy networks). CloudCruise is not responsible for the content, functionality, or data-handling practices of such providers. Your interactions with third parties are solely between you and them.

---

## 13. Termination

You may terminate your account at any time by emailing [founders@cloudcruise.com](mailto:founders@cloudcruise.com). We may suspend or terminate your access immediately (with or without notice) if you violate these Terms or we reasonably believe your use poses a security risk. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., payment obligations, IP rights, warranty disclaimers, dispute resolution) will continue after termination.

---

## 14. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED **“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”** CLOUDCRUISE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION.

---

## 15. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CLOUDCRUISE (AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, NOR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD WILL NOT EXCEED **(i) US \$500 OR (ii) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID CLOUDCRUISE FOR THE SERVICES DURING THAT PERIOD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER**.

---

## 16. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless CloudCruise and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to your: (a) use of the Services, (b) violation of these Terms, or (c) infringement of any intellectual-property or other right of any person or entity.

---

## 17. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by California law (excluding conflict-of-laws rules). Any dispute will be resolved **exclusively through binding, individual arbitration** in San Francisco County, California, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules, except that either party may seek injunctive relief to protect IP rights or pursue qualifying claims in small-claims court. **Class-action waivers apply.** You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by mailing a written opt-out notice to our address above.

---

## 18. Assignment

You may not transfer or assign these Terms or your rights without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations without restriction.

---

## 19. Miscellaneous

If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary, and the remainder will remain in effect. These Terms (together with any BAA and the Privacy Policy) are the entire agreement between you and CloudCruise regarding the Services and supersede all prior agreements. No agency, partnership, or joint venture is created by these Terms.
