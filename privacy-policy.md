# CloudCruise Privacy Policy

**Effective date: June 29 2025**

At CloudCruise, we believe automation should never come at the expense of trust. This Privacy Policy explains **what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have** when you use any CloudCruise product, website, API, or related services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to the practices described here.

*Last updated: June 29 2025. Material changes will be announced on the CloudCruise website and, where appropriate, by email.*

## 1. What This Policy Covers

This Policy addresses “**Personal Data**”—information that identifies or relates to an identifiable individual—and any other data we process on your behalf, including data you instruct our agents to capture from third-party sites. It does **not** cover:

* services we do not own or control;
* information handled solely on customer infrastructure when you deploy CloudCruise fully on-premise.

### Supplemental California & Nevada Notices
